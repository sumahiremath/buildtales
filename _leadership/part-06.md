# From IC to EM: Building Confidence Leading Former Peers

*Published on: August 27, 2025*

![ICEM](/assets/banners/resized/leadx-blog.jpg)

I still remember my first Monday as an engineering manager. On Friday, I was in a friendly back-and-forth with the team about code style in PR comments. On Monday, I was running our standup — and suddenly everyone was looking at me, waiting for direction.

One of my closest peers, the same person I'd gone to lunch with every day, asked me, *“So… what’s the plan?”*

I froze. A week ago, I would’ve been the one asking that question.

That moment was my *real* promotion — not the HR email, not the new title. It was realizing I had to show up differently, without losing the trust of the people who knew me as “one of them.”

## What You'll Learn
In this article:
- Why the IC → Manager identity shift feels so hard
- Three moves that build confidence fast
- Mistakes new managers often make
- A playbook for your first weeks leading former peers

## When Your Teammates Become Your Team
The first fear that hits new managers is credibility.

- *Will my peers respect me if I’m not coding as much?*
- *What if they think I’m not pulling my weight?*
- *What if I make the wrong call?*

I made the classic mistake: trying to prove myself by doing *everything* — coding heavily while also learning management. The result? Stretched thin, less effective in both.

The breakthrough was realizing: my team didn’t need me to out-code them. They needed me to make sure *they* could do their best work.

## Three Moves That Built My Confidence

### 1. Listen More Than You Talk
My first 1:1s were awkward — I came in with advice and updates. The shift came when I flipped it: I asked questions, listened, and took notes. Teams don’t expect their manager to know everything; they expect them to *care enough to listen*.

### 2. Shift From Problem-Solver to Unblocker
As an IC, solving problems was my default. As a manager, my job became clearing obstacles — fighting for resources, connecting the right people, making sure priorities were clear. The win wasn’t fixing the bug myself — it was watching the team move faster because I enabled them.

### 3. Build Trust Through Transparency
Teams don’t lose faith because of tough decisions; they lose faith when decisions feel arbitrary. I started explaining *why* we made tradeoffs, even when the answer wasn’t popular. Trust comes from context, not perfection.

## Lessons From *The Manager’s Path*
Camille Fournier’s *The Manager’s Path* gave me language for what I was experiencing. Three principles stuck:

- **1:1s are sacred.** They’re not for status, but for trust and growth.
- **Managers multiply, not add.** Your impact is measured in team effectiveness, not personal commits.
- **Feedback is a gift.** Giving and asking for feedback early builds clarity, not conflict.

---

## Mistakes You Don’t Have to Make
- **Over-managing** → Signals distrust and slows people down.
- **Inconsistent follow-through** → Kills credibility faster than lack of experience.
- **Avoiding hard conversations** → Protects no one; it just erodes respect.
- **Thinking peer respect disappears** → It doesn’t. It evolves if you lead with fairness.

---

## Your First 30 Days: A Playbook
- **Day 1:** Schedule listening-focused 1:1s — no agenda except understanding your team.
- **Week 1:** Write down your leadership principles (e.g. “I will prioritize transparency”) and share them.
- **Month 1:** Delegate one responsibility fully, and back your teammate publicly when they own it.
- **Always:** Remember Fournier’s message: your job is to multiply your team’s impact, not prove your own.

---

## Final Word
Your first job as a manager isn’t to be the best on the team — it’s to **build the best team.**
