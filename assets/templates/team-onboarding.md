# Team Onboarding Guide: AI-Assisted Development with Cursor

## Welcome to the Team! 🚀

This guide will help you get up and running with AI-assisted development using Cursor Pro. You'll be productive with AI assistance within your first week.

---

## Day 1: Setup & First Steps

### ✅ Setup Checklist
- [ ] Install Cursor Pro from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
- [ ] Import your existing VSCode settings (if applicable)
- [ ] Enable Cursor Pro (14-day trial)
- [ ] Join team communication channels
- [ ] Access project repositories
- [ ] Review team coding standards

### 🎯 First AI Experience
**Goal:** Generate your first AI-assisted code

**Exercise:** Create a simple "Hello World" program
1. Open Cursor and create a new file
2. Press `Ctrl+L` to open AI Chat
3. Ask: "Create a simple React component that displays 'Hello World'"
4. Let AI generate the code
5. Ask follow-up questions to understand the generated code

**Success Metric:** You can generate and modify simple code through conversation

---

## Day 2-3: Understanding AI Workflows

### 🤖 Chat vs Autocomplete
**Chat Mode** - Use for:
- Planning new features
- Debugging issues
- Learning new concepts
- Code reviews
- Architecture discussions

**Autocomplete** - Use for:
- Boilerplate code
- Completing patterns
- Staying in flow state
- Quick fixes

### 🧪 Mini Project: Calculator App
Build a simple calculator to practice both modes:

1. **Planning Phase (Chat):** "Plan a calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide functions"
2. **Implementation Phase (Autocomplete):** Let AI complete function implementations
3. **Enhancement Phase (Chat):** "Add error handling for division by zero"

**Success Metric:** You instinctively know which mode to use for different tasks

---

## Day 4-5: Team Standards & Cursor Rules

### 📋 Review Team Standards
- [ ] Read team coding guidelines
- [ ] Understand project structure
- [ ] Review testing requirements
- [ ] Learn deployment processes
- [ ] Understand code review workflow

### ⚙️ Cursor Rules Setup
**What are Cursor Rules?**
`.cursorrules` files that define AI behavior, coding standards, and project context.

**Team Rules Location:**
- Project root: `.cursorrules`
- Team standards: `docs/cursor-rules.md`
- Personal preferences: `~/.cursorrules` (optional)

**Exercise:** Test team rules
1. Ask AI to generate a component following team standards
2. Verify it matches your team's style
3. Ask for improvements if needed

**Success Metric:** AI consistently generates code matching team standards

---

## Day 6-7: First Real Task

### 🎯 Choose Your First Task
Select from:
- [ ] Fix a simple bug
- [ ] Add a small feature
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Write tests for existing code
- [ ] Refactor a simple component

### 🚀 AI-Assisted Development Workflow
1. **Plan:** Use Chat to understand requirements
2. **Implement:** Use Autocomplete for coding
3. **Review:** Use AI to review your code
4. **Test:** Ensure everything works
5. **Document:** Update relevant documentation

### 📝 Task Completion Checklist
- [ ] Code follows team standards
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Ready for deployment

**Success Metric:** Complete your first task using AI assistance

---

## Week 2: Building Confidence

### 🔍 Debugging with AI
**Exercise:** Debug an issue in the codebase
1. Use Chat to understand the problem
2. Ask AI to analyze error logs
3. Generate fixes with AI assistance
4. Test the solution thoroughly

### 📚 Learning New Technologies
**Exercise:** Learn a new library or framework
1. Ask AI to explain the technology
2. Generate example code
3. Ask for best practices
4. Build a small proof-of-concept

### 🤝 Team Collaboration
- [ ] Participate in AI-assisted code reviews
- [ ] Share AI tips with teammates
- [ ] Attend team AI best practices sessions
- [ ] Contribute to team Cursor Rules

---

## Week 3-4: Advanced Workflows

### 🏗️ Multi-File Refactoring
**Exercise:** Refactor a feature across multiple files
1. Use `@Files` and `@Folders` for context
2. Plan changes with AI assistance
3. Implement refactoring incrementally
4. Test thoroughly after each change

### 📊 Productivity Measurement
Track your progress:
- **Week 1:** 10-20% productivity improvement
- **Week 2:** 20-30% improvement
- **Week 3:** 30-40% improvement
- **Week 4:** 40-50% improvement

### 🎯 Advanced Techniques
- **Chain of Thought:** Break complex tasks into steps
- **Role Playing:** "Act as a senior developer reviewing this code"
- **Constraints:** "Solve this using only functional programming"
- **Templates:** "Generate a reusable template for..."

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### 🚨 "I don't know what to ask"
**Solution:** Start with "Explain this code" or "How would you improve this?"

### 🚨 "AI generates code I don't understand"
**Solution:** Always ask "Explain this code step by step" after generation

### 🚨 "AI doesn't follow our coding style"
**Solution:** Update your `.cursorrules` file with specific examples

### 🚨 "I'm becoming too dependent on AI"
**Solution:** Regularly code without AI assistance to maintain core skills
