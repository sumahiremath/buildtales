Welcome to **BuildTales.dev** 👋

I'm **Suma Manjunath** — legally known as *Sumalatha Manjunath*, and you'll often find me online as **Suma Hiremath**. I'm an engineering leader who thrives at the intersection of code, culture, and systems thinking.

This space is where I share stories, strategies, and sharp takes from years of building teams and tech in fast-moving industries like fintech.

Here’s what you’ll find here:

🧭 Engineering leadership & career growth  
🏗️ Designing and scaling software systems  
💸 Navigating complexity in domains like payments and fintech  
🧪 Lessons from the field — the wins, fails, and facepalms  
🧬 Team dynamics, trust, and engineering culture

If you're here to level up, lead better, or just lurk and learn — welcome.  
Let’s build some tales worth telling.
