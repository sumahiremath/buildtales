# About

Hi, I’m **Suma Manjunath**—an engineering leader with 20 years of experience delivering scalable, resilient software in tightly regulated industries. I thrive on building systems rooted in automation, observability, and compliance-aligned best practices.

## The Journey

My path began in QA, where I developed a quality-first mindset that propelled me into development and ultimately leadership. Now, I lead initiatives focused on modernizing legacy architectures, driving microservices adoption, and embedding observability across engineering ecosystems. I’ve guided teams through fintech transformations, built large-scale payments infrastructure, and navigated complex financial compliance—where “move fast” meets “don’t break anything.”

## Why I Write

**Build Tales** captures stories from the engineering trenches—addressing the messy middle of scaling teams, legacy systems, and compliance puzzles that glossy case studies overlook. My ongoing series, “How U.S. Payments Really Work,” spans 45 articles aimed at helping engineers build systems that earn trust by understanding money’s real-life path through banks, networks, and regulatory frameworks.

My current deep dive, "[How U.S. Payments Really Work](/how-us-payments-actually-work/)," is a 45-article survival manual for anyone building platforms that move money. Because understanding how money flows through banks, payment networks, and regulatory frameworks isn't just technical knowledge—it's the foundation for building systems that earn trust.

## Beyond the Keyboard

Outside of work, I savor my daily cup of black coffee, walk my dog, and explore the world through photography. I also dive into cooking, tend to my garden, and stay curious with AI trends and physical/mental wellness practices. This intentional balance isn’t just a hobby—it keeps my leadership grounded and energized.
