### The Journey

I started in QA, where a **quality-first mindset** shaped how I approach every layer of engineering. That foundation led me into development and, eventually, leadership roles guiding teams through modernization efforts.

Iâ€™m especially interested in **microservices and distributed systems**, **AI**, and **crypto**â€”areas shaping the future of engineering and payments. Exploring service decomposition, resilience patterns, intelligent automation, and digital asset infrastructure excites me because they sit at the intersection of innovation and trust.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve also:
- Built **payments infrastructure** that balances speed with compliance
- Embedded **observability and automation** across engineering ecosystems
- Guided teams through **legacy modernization** while keeping production stable
- Defined **strategic roadmaps** that align technical execution with business goals

This blend of curiosity, delivery, and forward-looking strategy fuels my perspective on building systems that last.

### Why I Write

**Build Tales** is where I share stories from the trenchesâ€”practical insights that don't always make it into polished case studies. All articles are based on real-world engineering practice. Ideas are my own, written with AI assistance for speed, and reviewed by me for accuracy and reliability.

My current series, **"How U.S. Payments Really Work,"** is a 50+ article survival manual for anyone building platforms that move money. It breaks down the railsâ€”ACH, cards, wires, wallets, faster payments, and cryptoâ€”showing how money truly flows through banks, networks, and regulators.

I also write about:
- **Engineering leadership** â€” scaling teams without losing culture
- **Systems architecture** â€” balancing legacy with modern design patterns
- **Payments infrastructure** â€” building platforms that earn trust through compliance and reliability
- **Emerging technologies** â€” exploring how **AI** and **crypto** are reshaping the engineering and financial landscape

Across these themes, the thread is the same: **turning complexity into clarity so engineers can build with confidence.**

### Beyond the Keyboard
When Iâ€™m not untangling systems, youâ€™ll usually find me:
- Enjoying a strong cup of **black coffee**
- Walking my **dog**
- Exploring the world through **photography**
- Experimenting in the **kitchen** and tending my **garden**
- Staying curious about **AI, wellness, and mindfulness**

This balance keeps my leadership grounded and my creativity alive.

ðŸ‘‰ At **Build Tales**, you'll find lessons, frameworks, and survival patterns for engineers navigating the real world of **systems, leadership, payments, and the technologies shaping what comes next.**
