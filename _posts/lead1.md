# From IC to EM: Building Confidence Leading Former Peers

![ICEM](/assets/banners/resized/lead1-blog.jpg)

I still remember my first Monday as an engineering manager. On Friday, I was in a friendly banter with the team debating code style in PR comments. On Monday, I was running our standup — and suddenly everyone was looking at me, waiting for direction.

One of my closest peers, the same person I'd gone to lunch with every day, asked me, "So… what's the plan?" I froze for a second. A week ago, I would've been the one asking that question.

That moment was my real promotion — not the HR email, not the new title. It was realizing I had to show up differently, without losing the trust of the people who knew me as "one of them."

## What You'll Learn

In this article, we'll cover:
- The identity shift from IC to manager and why it's so challenging
- Practical frameworks for building confidence without proving yourself
- How to maintain respect while changing your role
- Actionable steps for your first weeks as a new engineering manager

## The Shift: Peer to Manager

The first fear that hits new managers is credibility.

Will my peers respect me if I'm not in the trenches coding as much?

What if they think I'm not pulling my weight?

What if I make the wrong call?

For me, this translated into trying to do too much: still contributing technically while also learning the ropes of management. I ended up stretched thin and, ironically, less effective in both.

The breakthrough came when I realized: my team didn't need me to prove I could out-code them. They needed me to make sure they could do their best work.

## A Framework That Helped Me Build Confidence

### Listen More Than You Talk

My first few 1:1s were awkward — I showed up with updates and advice. The real shift came when I flipped it: I asked questions, listened, and took notes. People don't expect their manager to have all the answers; they expect them to care enough to listen.

### Shift From Problem-Solver to Unblocker

As an IC, solving problems was my default mode. As a manager, my job became clearing obstacles, not owning fixes. Sometimes that meant fighting for resources, sometimes just connecting the right two people. The win wasn't solving the bug myself — it was seeing the team move faster because I enabled them.

### Build Trust Through Transparency

I learned quickly that teams don't lose faith because of tough decisions — they lose faith when decisions feel arbitrary. I started explaining why we were making tradeoffs, even when the answer wasn't popular. Trust comes from context, not perfection.

## What The Manager's Path Taught Me

Camille Fournier's *The Manager's Path* became a north star during this transition. Three principles stuck with me:

1. **1:1s are sacred, not optional.** They're not for status updates, but for trust-building and growth conversations. Once I shifted to treating 1:1s as my most important meetings, my team's engagement changed.

2. **Your job is to multiply, not add.** As Fournier puts it, managers exist to make the whole team more effective. That means letting go of the dopamine hit of closing tickets yourself.

3. **Feedback is a gift — give it and ask for it often.** My first instinct was to avoid hard conversations. The book reframed feedback as a tool for clarity and support, not criticism.

These weren't abstract lessons; they gave me a language for the shift I was experiencing. Instead of "losing" my IC identity, I was gaining new tools to help my team succeed.

## Lessons I Learned the Hard Way

- **Over-managing backfires.** Trying to oversee every detail signaled a lack of trust.
- **Confidence comes from consistency.** Following through on commitments mattered more than bold speeches.
- **Peer relationships evolve, not vanish.** Respect isn't automatic, but it deepens when you show fairness and integrity.

## Actionable Takeaways for New Engineering Managers

If you're stepping into leadership for the first time, especially with former peers:

**Day 1:** Schedule listening-focused 1:1s — no agenda except understanding your team.

**Week 1:** Write down your own leadership principles (e.g., "I will prioritize transparency"); share them with your team.

**Month 1:** Pick one responsibility you can delegate — and back your teammate publicly when they own it.

**Always:** Remember Fournier's core message: your job is to multiply your team's impact, not prove your own.

## Key Takeaways

- Confidence as a new manager comes from enabling others, not proving yourself
- The identity shift is real and takes time — be patient with yourself
- Focus on listening, unblocking, and transparency rather than technical contribution
- Your team needs you to lead, not to code alongside them
