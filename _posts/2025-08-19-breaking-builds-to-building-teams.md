# Breaking Builds to Building Teams: How QA Sculpted Me Into an Engineering Leader

![Breaking Builds to Building Teams](/assets/banners/resized/20250819qatolead-blog.jpg)

I didn't set out to be an engineering leader. I started in QA — breaking builds, filing bugs, and thinking of every possible way software could fail. At the time, it felt like my role was to slow things down.

What I didn't realize then was that QA was sculpting me for leadership. The habits I built as a QA engineer — systems thinking, risk awareness, prioritization, empathy — became the foundation for how I lead teams today.

---

## Ship Beyond the Code

QA taught me to see the whole system. Every bug wasn't just a defect — it rippled through customers, support, and business outcomes.

As a leader, that translates into outcomes over outputs. I don't just ask if the code works. I ask: how does this impact customers, ops, and revenue?

> Shipping code isn't the finish line — it's the starting line for impact.

---

## Think Adversarially (Before Production Does)

QA's favorite question: *"How do I break this?"*  
As a leader, mine is: *"How will reality break this?"*

That mindset drives risk assessments in planning, contingency strategies, and designing for graceful failure instead of heroic firefights.

> If you don't try to break it first, production will gladly do it for you.

---

## Automate the Routine, Focus on the Creative

Manual testing doesn't scale. Neither does manual leadership.

Automation gives teams confidence and speed: CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, onboarding flows, decision frameworks. Anything repeatable gets automated so humans can focus on higher-value work.

> Automate the predictable so people can tackle the impossible.

---

## Documentation as a Force Multiplier

QA survives on repro steps and bug reports.

As a leader, I scale that instinct: ADRs that explain *why*, runbooks that capture hard-won fixes, retros that prevent mistakes from repeating. Documentation isn't bureaucracy — it's leadership insurance.

> Good documentation outlives any manager — and that's the point.

---

## Prioritize Risk, Not Perfection

QA taught me not every bug is worth fixing. Leadership taught me the same: not every refactor is worth delaying a feature.

Risk-based thinking keeps teams shipping value while managing technical debt pragmatically.

> Perfection is optional. Progress is not.

---

## Empathy Is a Leadership Tool

QA often meant delivering bad news: *"Sorry, I broke your feature."*  

Leadership is similar: *"Sorry, we broke your weekend."*  

Either way, empathy in hard conversations builds trust that lasts longer than any sprint.

> Empathy doesn't slow delivery — it accelerates trust.

---

## QA: My First Stint as a Padawan

Looking back, QA was my first apprenticeship in leadership.  
It was my padawan phase — training me to see systems, anticipate risk, and learn from failure.

- **Systems Thinking:** QA showed me every bug was part of a bigger flow.  
- **Feedback Loops:** QA created habits of catching issues early, not waiting for production.  
- **Continuous Learning:** Every bug became tuition paid toward building better systems.  

> QA wasn't a detour — it was my Jedi training for leadership.

---

## Closing

Breaking builds taught me how systems fail.  
Building teams taught me how people succeed.  

QA wasn't a detour from leadership. It was my apprenticeship — the padawan stage that shaped how I lead today.

> Breaking builds prepared me for the real work: building people and teams.
