## Creating and Managing .cursorrules Files

**You can find and create .cursorrules files in several locations:**

### **Primary Location**
**Project root directory** - Create a .cursorrules file in your project's root folder (same level as package.json, README.md, etc.)

```
my-project/
├── .cursorrules          <- Create it here
├── package.json
├── src/
└── README.md
```

### **How to Create It**

**Method 1: In Cursor**
1. Open your project in Cursor
2. Right-click in the file explorer
3. Select "New File"
4. Name it `.cursorrules` (with the dot at the beginning)

**Method 2: Command Line**
```bash
touch .cursorrules
```

**Method 3: File Explorer**
1. Create a new text file
2. Name it `.cursorrules` (some systems might warn about files starting with a dot)

### **Global vs Project-Specific**

**Project-specific (recommended):**
- `.cursorrules` in your project root
- Only affects that specific project
- More flexible and maintainable

**Global (less common):**
- Cursor may support global rules, but project-specific is more flexible
- Useful for personal coding preferences across all projects

### **Template to Start With**

Create `.cursorrules` and add:

```
You are an expert in [your tech stack].

Code Style:
- [your preferences]
- [specific patterns you want]

Project Structure:
- [how you organize files]
- [naming conventions]

Best Practices:
- [error handling approach]
- [testing requirements]
- [documentation standards]
```

### **Verification**

After creating the file, ask Cursor to generate some code - it should follow the rules you've defined.

**Note:** The file should be named exactly `.cursorrules` (with a dot, no extension) for Cursor to recognize it automatically.
