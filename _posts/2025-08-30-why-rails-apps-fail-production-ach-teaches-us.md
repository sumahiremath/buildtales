# Why Rails Apps Fail in Production (and What ACH Teaches Us)

![Why Rails Apps Fail in Production (and What ACH Teaches Us)](/assets/banners/resized/20250830railsfail-blog.jpg)


When I first read *Release It!* by Michael Nygard, one phrase stuck:  

> **Most systems fail in production, not because of bugs, but because of unpredictable real-world conditions.**

That's especially true in fintech. You can build the cleanest Rails codebase, pass every test, and still hit walls in production once **ACH payments** start flowing.

## Reliability Fundamentals (Quick Primer)

Before diving in, let's define a few system design terms that matter for financial systems:  

- **Availability** ‚Äì the percentage of time your system is up and functioning.  
- **Consistency** ‚Äì whether all users see the same state at the same time.  
- **Partition Tolerance** ‚Äì how your system behaves when parts of it cannot communicate.  

Together, these form the **CAP theorem**. In payment systems like ACH, we often trade **immediate consistency** for **eventual consistency** (e.g., showing "Payment Submitted" while settlement completes later).  

Reliability is usually framed in **SLAs** (Service Level Agreements) and **error budgets**. For example:  
- SLA: "ACH submission API is available 99.9% of the time."  
- Error budget: "We can afford up to 43 minutes of downtime per month."  

These concepts are not just theory ‚Äî they directly impact customer trust and regulatory compliance.

## Common Failure Modes in Rails ACH Apps

Here are the ways Rails apps typically fail in ACH contexts, and how to design against them:

1. **Network Instability**  
   - Problem: ACH API calls time out or return 5xx errors.  
   - Mitigation: Use retries with **exponential backoff** and upper bounds.  

   ```ruby
   # ‚ùå Bad: naive retry
   response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, payload)
   response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, payload) if response.code != "200"

   # ‚úÖ Better: exponential backoff
   attempts = 0
   begin
     response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, payload)
   rescue Timeout::Error
     attempts += 1
     sleep(2**attempts) # 2s, 4s, 8s...
     retry if attempts < 3
   end
   ```

2. **Duplicate Submissions**  
   - Problem: retries or race conditions resubmit the same ACH file.  
   - Mitigation: Idempotency keys and database uniqueness constraints.  

3. **Slow Dependencies**  
   - Problem: one slow bank call ties up Puma threads.  
   - Mitigation: Connection pooling, timeouts, and circuit breakers.  

4. **Poor Error Messaging**  
   - Problem: vague "Something went wrong."  
   - Mitigation: map ACH return codes to user-facing messages.  

5. **Operational Blind Spots**  
   - Problem: no visibility into retry counts or settlement delays.  
   - Mitigation: monitor queue length, error rates, and SLA adherence.  

## Example: Rails ACH Payment Flow

Let's model a simple ACH payment flow with potential failure points:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant RailsApp
    participant ACHProvider
    participant Bank

    User->>RailsApp: Submit payment request
    RailsApp->>ACHProvider: API call (ACH debit)
    ACHProvider->>Bank: Forward to ACH network
    Bank-->>ACHProvider: Settlement response (delayed)
    ACHProvider-->>RailsApp: Acknowledgment (pending)
    RailsApp-->>User: Show "Payment Submitted"

    Note over RailsApp,ACHProvider: Failure points: timeouts, retries, duplicates
```

Notice the eventual consistency: the user sees "Payment Submitted," but the real truth (settlement) arrives hours or days later. This is a distributed system challenge: availability vs. consistency under network partitions.

## Lessons From Release It! Applied to ACH

- **Expect Failure**: Design your ACH integration assuming timeouts and retries.
- **Isolate Dependencies**: Don't let a slow bank bring down your app (use circuit breakers).
- **Communicate Clearly**: Be honest about settlement delays ‚Äî that's eventual consistency in action.
- **Measure Against SLAs**: Track whether your retry logic and provider uptime respect error budgets.

## Coming Up Next

In the next post, we'll dive into stability patterns from Release It! and show how to apply them to Rails ACH systems ‚Äî starting with circuit breakers.

## Key Takeaways

- ACH is the perfect playground for studying system reliability.
- Rails apps fail in production not just due to bugs, but due to distributed system realities like partitions, latency, and eventual consistency.
- By applying Release It! patterns (timeouts, retries, idempotency), we can build resilient, trustworthy payment systems.
