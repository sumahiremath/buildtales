# Reconciling Like a Ghost: ACH Ops for Third-Party Service Providers

*Published on: December 31, 2025*

![ACH Operations](/assets/banners/resized/20250813moneyflow-blog.jpg)

As a Third-Party Service Provider (TPSP), you're operating in the shadows of the banking system. You don't have access to the underlying bank balance — just the files you send and the return files you receive. This creates a unique challenge: how do you reconcile your operations when you can't see the bank's books?

This article explains how to reconcile via metadata, file logging, and trace ID correlation when you're operating blind to the actual settlement.

## The Ghost Reconciler's Challenge

**TPSPs operate in a world of partial visibility:**

- You see your submitted ACH files
- You receive return files and acknowledgments
- You track your own ledger states
- But you never see the actual bank balance

This creates a reconciliation gap that can hide operational issues, compliance problems, and financial discrepancies.

## Building Your Ghost Reconciler

### 1. File-Level Reconciliation

Every ACH file you submit should be logged with:
- File creation timestamp
- Batch number and sequence
- Total entry count and dollar amount
- Expected settlement date
- Trace ID ranges

```python
class ACHFileLogger:
    def log_file_submission(self, file_data):
        return {
            'file_id': generate_uuid(),
            'submission_time': datetime.utcnow(),
            'batch_count': file_data.batch_count,
            'entry_count': file_data.total_entries,
            'dollar_amount': file_data.total_amount,
            'expected_settlement': calculate_settlement_date(),
            'trace_id_start': file_data.trace_id_start,
            'trace_id_end': file_data.trace_id_end,
            'status': 'submitted'
        }
```

### 2. Return File Correlation

When return files arrive, correlate them back to your original submissions:

```python
def correlate_returns(return_file, original_files):
    """Match return entries back to original file submissions"""
    correlations = []
    
    for return_entry in return_file.entries:
        # Find the original file that contained this trace ID
        original_file = find_file_by_trace_id(
            return_entry.trace_id, 
            original_files
        )
        
        if original_file:
            correlations.append({
                'return_entry': return_entry,
                'original_file': original_file,
                'time_to_return': calculate_time_delta(
                    original_file.submission_time,
                    return_file.received_time
                )
            })
    
    return correlations
```

### 3. Metadata-Based Reconciliation

Use the metadata from your files to build a reconciliation framework:

```python
class ACHReconciler:
    def reconcile_file_cycle(self, file_id):
        """Reconcile a complete ACH file lifecycle"""
        file_log = self.get_file_log(file_id)
        acknowledgments = self.get_acknowledgments(file_id)
        returns = self.get_returns_for_file(file_id)
        
        reconciliation = {
            'file_id': file_id,
            'submitted_entries': file_log.entry_count,
            'acknowledged_entries': acknowledgments.accepted_count,
            'rejected_entries': acknowledgments.rejected_count,
            'returned_entries': len(returns),
            'discrepancy': self.calculate_discrepancy(file_log, acknowledgments, returns)
        }
        
        return reconciliation
```

## The Three Pillars of Ghost Reconciliation

### Pillar 1: Trace ID Tracking

Every ACH entry has a unique trace ID. Use this to build your reconciliation backbone:

```python
def build_trace_id_map(submitted_files):
    """Create a map of all trace IDs to their source files"""
    trace_map = {}
    
    for file in submitted_files:
        for entry in file.entries:
            trace_map[entry.trace_id] = {
                'file_id': file.file_id,
                'entry_index': entry.index,
                'amount': entry.amount,
                'account': entry.account,
                'submission_time': file.submission_time
            }
    
    return trace_map
```

### Pillar 2: File Acknowledgment Monitoring

Track every acknowledgment to ensure your files were received:

```python
def monitor_file_acknowledgments():
    """Monitor for missing or delayed file acknowledgments"""
    expected_acks = get_pending_acknowledgments()
    
    for expected in expected_acks:
        if is_acknowledgment_overdue(expected):
            alert_operations_team(
                f"Missing acknowledgment for file {expected.file_id}"
            )
        
        if has_acknowledgment_discrepancy(expected):
            flag_reconciliation_issue(expected)
```

### Pillar 3: Return Pattern Analysis

Analyze return patterns to identify systemic issues:

```python
def analyze_return_patterns(returns_data):
    """Identify patterns in ACH returns"""
    patterns = {
        'return_codes': {},
        'time_to_return': [],
        'account_patterns': {},
        'amount_patterns': {}
    }
    
    for return_entry in returns_data:
        # Track return code frequency
        patterns['return_codes'][return_entry.return_code] = \
            patterns['return_codes'].get(return_entry.return_code, 0) + 1
        
        # Track time to return
        patterns['time_to_return'].append(return_entry.days_to_return)
        
        # Track account patterns
        account = return_entry.account_number[-4:]  # Last 4 digits
        patterns['account_patterns'][account] = \
            patterns['account_patterns'].get(account, 0) + 1
    
    return patterns
```

## Building Your Reconciliation Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **File Success Rate**: Submitted vs. Acknowledged files
2. **Entry Success Rate**: Submitted vs. Accepted entries
3. **Return Rate**: Entries returned as percentage of accepted
4. **Time to Return**: Average days between submission and return
5. **Reconciliation Discrepancies**: Files that don't balance

### Alerting and Escalation

```python
def setup_reconciliation_alerts():
    """Configure alerts for reconciliation issues"""
    alerts = {
        'high_return_rate': {
            'threshold': 0.05,  # 5% return rate
            'action': 'immediate_alert'
        },
        'missing_acknowledgment': {
            'threshold': 300,  # 5 minutes
            'action': 'escalate_to_ops'
        },
        'reconciliation_mismatch': {
            'threshold': 0,  # Any mismatch
            'action': 'stop_trading'
        }
    }
    
    return alerts
```

## The Ghost Reconciler's Toolkit

### 1. File Comparison Tools

Compare your submitted files with received acknowledgments:

```python
def compare_file_totals(submitted, acknowledged):
    """Compare submitted vs acknowledged file totals"""
    discrepancies = []
    
    for submitted_file in submitted:
        ack = find_acknowledgment(submitted_file.file_id)
        
        if not ack:
            discrepancies.append({
                'type': 'missing_acknowledgment',
                'file_id': submitted_file.file_id,
                'severity': 'critical'
            })
            continue
        
        if submitted_file.entry_count != ack.accepted_count + ack.rejected_count:
            discrepancies.append({
                'type': 'entry_count_mismatch',
                'file_id': submitted_file.file_id,
                'submitted': submitted_file.entry_count,
                'acknowledged': ack.accepted_count + ack.rejected_count,
                'severity': 'high'
            })
    
    return discrepancies
```

### 2. Trace ID Validation

Validate that every trace ID in your system can be accounted for:

```python
def validate_trace_id_coverage():
    """Ensure all trace IDs are accounted for"""
    submitted_ids = get_all_submitted_trace_ids()
    acknowledged_ids = get_all_acknowledged_trace_ids()
    returned_ids = get_all_returned_trace_ids()
    
    # All submitted IDs should be either acknowledged or returned
    unaccounted = submitted_ids - (acknowledged_ids | returned_ids)
    
    if unaccounted:
        log_reconciliation_error(f"Unaccounted trace IDs: {len(unaccounted)}")
        return False
    
    return True
```

### 3. Settlement Date Tracking

Track expected vs. actual settlement dates:

```python
def track_settlement_dates():
    """Monitor settlement date accuracy"""
    expected_settlements = get_expected_settlements()
    
    for expected in expected_settlements:
        if is_settlement_overdue(expected):
            investigate_settlement_delay(expected)
        
        if has_settlement_discrepancy(expected):
            flag_settlement_issue(expected)
```

## Operational Best Practices

### 1. Daily Reconciliation

Run reconciliation checks daily, not just at month-end:

```python
def daily_reconciliation_check():
    """Perform daily reconciliation checks"""
    today = datetime.utcnow().date()
    
    # Check yesterday's files
    yesterday_files = get_files_by_date(today - timedelta(days=1))
    
    for file in yesterday_files:
        reconciliation = reconcile_file_cycle(file.file_id)
        
        if reconciliation['discrepancy']:
            escalate_reconciliation_issue(reconciliation)
```

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring

Monitor file acknowledgments in real-time:

```python
def real_time_acknowledgment_monitor():
    """Monitor acknowledgments as they arrive"""
    while True:
        new_acks = get_new_acknowledgments()
        
        for ack in new_acks:
            process_acknowledgment(ack)
            
            if has_acknowledgment_issues(ack):
                alert_immediately(ack)
        
        time.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
```

### 3. Automated Reconciliation

Automate as much reconciliation as possible:

```python
def automated_reconciliation_pipeline():
    """Automated reconciliation pipeline"""
    while True:
        # Get new files
        new_files = get_new_submitted_files()
        
        for file in new_files:
            # Log file submission
            log_file_submission(file)
            
            # Set up monitoring
            setup_file_monitoring(file)
            
            # Schedule reconciliation checks
            schedule_reconciliation_checks(file)
        
        time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute
```

## When Reconciliation Fails

### Common Failure Modes

1. **Missing Acknowledgments**: Files submitted but never acknowledged
2. **Entry Count Mismatches**: Submitted vs. acknowledged entry counts don't match
3. **Return Correlation Failures**: Can't match returns back to original submissions
4. **Settlement Date Discrepancies**: Expected vs. actual settlement dates don't align

### Escalation Procedures

```python
def escalation_procedure(issue):
    """Escalation procedure for reconciliation issues"""
    if issue['severity'] == 'critical':
        # Stop all trading
        stop_trading()
        # Alert senior management
        alert_senior_management(issue)
        # Initiate incident response
        initiate_incident_response(issue)
    
    elif issue['severity'] == 'high':
        # Alert operations team
        alert_operations_team(issue)
        # Flag for manual review
        flag_for_manual_review(issue)
    
    elif issue['severity'] == 'medium':
        # Log for review
        log_for_review(issue)
        # Monitor for escalation
        monitor_for_escalation(issue)
```

## The Ghost Reconciler's Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Reconciliation Accuracy**: 99.9%+ accuracy in file reconciliation
2. **Time to Reconciliation**: < 24 hours for file-level reconciliation
3. **Return Correlation Rate**: 100% of returns correlated to original submissions
4. **Alert Response Time**: < 5 minutes for critical reconciliation issues

### Continuous Improvement

```python
def reconciliation_improvement_loop():
    """Continuous improvement loop for reconciliation"""
    while True:
        # Analyze reconciliation performance
        performance = analyze_reconciliation_performance()
        
        # Identify improvement opportunities
        opportunities = identify_improvement_opportunities(performance)
        
        # Implement improvements
        for opportunity in opportunities:
            implement_improvement(opportunity)
        
        # Measure impact
        measure_improvement_impact(opportunities)
        
        # Wait for next cycle
        time.sleep(86400)  # Daily
```

## Conclusion

Operating as a TPSP means reconciling in the dark, but it doesn't mean you have to operate blindly. By building robust metadata tracking, file logging, and trace ID correlation systems, you can achieve reconciliation accuracy that rivals direct bank access.

The key is to treat every piece of metadata as a reconciliation anchor point. Every file submission, acknowledgment, and return becomes a data point in your reconciliation framework. When you can't see the bank's books, you make your own books so detailed and accurate that they become the source of truth.

Remember: **Ghost reconciliation isn't about seeing what you can't see — it's about making what you can see so comprehensive that you don't need to see the rest.**
