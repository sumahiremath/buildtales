Engineering + Compliance: A Survival Guide for Regulated Environments

When engineers talk about blockers, they usually mean flaky tests or broken CI. In regulated industries, the biggest blocker often wears a different badge: compliance.

In my early days in fintech, I saw compliance as a hurdle to clear at the end of development. Build the feature, then send it to compliance for review. That approach backfired. Audits uncovered gaps, deadlines slipped, and frustration grew on all sides.

The truth is, in regulated industries, compliance isn’t the opposite of engineering velocity — it’s the foundation that makes velocity sustainable.

The Tension: Compliance as “No” vs Compliance as Enabler

Engineers feel compliance slows them down.

Compliance officers feel engineers don’t take regulations seriously.

Executives expect compliance to be built in from the start — and panic when it isn’t.

This tension comes from treating compliance as an external force instead of a partner in building.

A Framework for Partnering With Compliance

Bring Compliance in Early

Involve compliance at design reviews, not just launches.

Ask them: “What risks should we design out now?”

Translate Risk Into Shared Language

Engineers talk about latency or memory leaks; compliance talks about liability and consumer harm.

As a manager, your job is to bridge those vocabularies.

Build Guardrails, Not Gates

Guardrails = pre-defined checks that keep development moving (linting rules, automated audit logs).

Gates = hard stops that create frustration. Favor guardrails.

What The Manager’s Path Reinforced

Camille Fournier reminds us: cross-functional influence is core to leadership. As you rise, success depends less on your code and more on your ability to collaborate with peers outside engineering.

The book highlights a simple truth: managers have to translate risk across disciplines. That’s exactly the muscle you build when partnering with compliance — taking regulatory risk and reframing it as technical risk the team can act on.

Lessons I Learned the Hard Way

Treating compliance as an afterthought creates rework. Last-minute reviews are expensive.

Overpromising before compliance review is dangerous. Sales teams get burned, customers get disappointed.

Audits surface what culture hides. If compliance isn’t in the room, shortcuts will find their way in.

Actionable Takeaways

Invite compliance to design kickoffs. It signals respect and prevents rework.

Create a shared glossary. Make sure engineers and compliance use the same terms for risk.

Automate where possible. Audit logs, access controls, and alerts reduce human friction.

Frame compliance as a design constraint. Like latency or cost, it’s a parameter to design around — not a roadblock.

Closing Thought

In regulated industries, compliance isn’t a tax on innovation — it’s a multiplier of trust. The companies that win aren’t the ones who sneak features past compliance; they’re the ones who design with compliance in mind from the start. As an engineering leader, your survival doesn’t depend on fighting compliance. It depends on partnering with them to build systems that are both fast and safe.
