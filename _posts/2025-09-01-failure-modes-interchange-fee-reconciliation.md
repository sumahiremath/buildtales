**For:** Payment engineers, finance systems architects  
**Reading Time:** 12 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with card processing flows, Rails background job frameworks  
**Why now:** Interchange downgrades are rising with new scheme rules—misreporting margins creates material financial risk.  

> **TL;DR:**  
> - Authorization interchange is **only a provisional estimate**, not final economics.  
> - Settlement introduces **data, timing, and reclassification adjustments** that change fees.  
> - Treating auth as final creates reconciliation noise and margin misreporting.  
> - Build variance tracking pipelines to **close the loop between auth and settlement**.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: All scenarios, accounts, names, and data used in examples are not real. They are realistic scenarios provided only for educational and illustrative purposes.

## Problem Definition

**The challenge:** Many payment systems treat authorization fees as final, leading to reconciliation mismatches when settlement occurs.  

**Who faces this:** Merchants, PSPs, and finance teams handling high transaction volumes.  

**Cost of inaction:** Reconciliation breaks, finance reporting errors, margin leakage of tens of thousands monthly.  

**Why current approaches fail:** Most ledger systems don’t model fee variances explicitly, hiding downgrade causes from engineering.  

---

## The Misconception

Many assume **authorization = final economics**. In reality:  

- **Auth (T0):** Approval + provisional fee category.  
- **Settlement (T+1…T+3):** Networks compute **final fee** with complete data.

    end

## Why Auth ≠ Settlement

Final interchange differs due to:  

- **Data Downgrades** – missing AVS, CVV, postal code, Level II/III data.  
- **Timing Downgrades** – late clearing (>24h), partial captures.  
- **Reclassification** – MCC changes, recurring flag mis-set, cross-border detection.  
- **Amount Mismatch** – tips, amended amounts, FX conversions.  
- **Network Rule Updates** – scheme changes applied at clearing.

**Impact:**  
- Finance books don’t tie.  
- Ops spends hours chasing deltas.  
- Margins misreported.

## Real-World Impact

On a $100 txn:  
- Estimated = $1.75  
- Final = $2.00 (due to MISSING_AVS)  
- Variance = +$0.25 (unfavorable)  

Across **100,000 transactions/month**, this becomes **$25,000 in hidden costs**.

## Solution Implementation (Rails Example)

We’ll build a pipeline to:  
1. Estimate fees at auth.  
2. Ingest settlement files.  
3. Record variances + downgrade reasons.  

### Data Model

```ruby
create_table :payments do |t|
  t.string  :psp_txn_id, null: false
  t.string  :card_brand, :mcc, :entry_mode, :recurring_flag, :currency
  t.bigint  :amount_minor, null: false
  t.datetime :authorized_at, :captured_at, :settled_at
end

create_table :interchange_estimates do |t|
  t.references :payment
  t.decimal :rate_bps
  t.decimal :per_txn_fee_minor
end

create_table :interchange_finalizations do |t|
  t.references :payment
  t.decimal :final_rate_bps, :final_per_txn_fee_minor, :final_amount_minor
  t.jsonb :downgrade_reasons, default: []
end

create_table :interchange_variances do |t|
  t.references :payment
  t.decimal :estimated_fee_minor, :final_fee_minor, :variance_minor
end
```

### Estimate at Auth

```ruby
module Interchange
  class Estimator
    def estimate(payment:)
      bucket = [payment.card_brand, payment.entry_mode, payment.recurring_flag, payment.mcc].join(":")
      rule   = @rate_table.fetch(bucket)
      pct    = ((payment.amount_minor * rule[:bps]) / 10_000.0).round
      total  = pct + rule[:per_txn_fee_minor]

      InterchangeEstimate.create!(payment:, rate_bps: rule[:bps], per_txn_fee_minor: rule[:per_txn_fee_minor])
      total
    end
  end
end
```

### Finalize at Settlement

```ruby
module Interchange
  class Finalizer
    def apply!(payment:, row:)
      final_fee = ((row.settlement_amount_minor * row.final_rate_bps) / 10_000.0).round + row.final_per_txn_fee_minor
      estimated = payment.interchange_estimates.last

      InterchangeFinalization.create!(payment:, final_rate_bps: row.final_rate_bps, downgrade_reasons: row.downgrade_reasons)
      InterchangeVariance.create!(payment:, estimated_fee_minor: estimated_total(estimated), final_fee_minor: final_fee, variance_minor: final_fee - estimated_total(estimated))
    end

    def estimated_total(est) = ((est.payment.amount_minor * est.rate_bps) / 10_000.0).round + est.per_txn_fee_minor
  end
end
```

## Ops Playbook

  Settlement[Settlement File] --> Finalize[Finalize Fees]
  Finalize --> Variance[Record Variance + Reasons]
  Variance --> Reporting[Ops/Finance Dashboards]
  Reporting --> Fixes[Engineering Fixes]
```
![Ops playbook diagram for reconciliation loop](fallbacks/ops-playbook.png)

💡 **Tip:** Map downgrade reasons to specific engineering fixes:  
- MISSING_AVS → enforce ZIP at checkout.  
- LATE_CLEARING → run capture jobs within 24h.  
- MISSING_CVV → reject requests missing CVV.  
- RECURRING MISFLAGGED → fix subscription flags.  

---

## Validation & Monitoring

- **Validation:** Compare provisional accrual vs. final fee in variance table.  
- **Monitoring:** Alert on unfavorable variance > X bps.  
- **Failure Modes:** Missing downgrade reasons → finance blind spots.  

---

## Takeaways

- Authorization interchange is **only a hint**.  
- Settlement determines **final economics**.  
- Build systems that **estimate → finalize → explain**.  
- Variance tracking converts noise into **actionable engineering fixes**.

## Acronym

- **AVS:** Address Verification Service  
- **CNP/CP:** Card Not Present / Card Present  
- **MCC:** Merchant Category Code  
- **PSP:** Payment Service Provider  
- **Issuer:** Bank issuing the card  
- **Acquirer:** Bank acquiring merchant transactions  
- **Downgrade:** Movement into higher-cost interchange bucket  
- **BPS:** Basis points (100 bps = 1%)
