# ACH Retries: Designing a Safe and Compliant Retry Engine

*Why retries are not just a technical decision — they're a regulatory minefield.*

![ACH retry Banner](/assets/banners/resized/20251001achretry-blog.jpg)

ACH retry are one of the trickiest payment system pain points. They sit at the intersection of **Reg E compliance**, **user trust**, and **technical resilience**. If you build retry logic like you build HTTP retries, you'll end up in **NACHA/CFPB hell**.

This article explores why ACH retries are fundamentally different from other retry mechanisms, and how to design systems that respect both regulatory requirements and user expectations.

## Reg E: The Ground Rules

The **Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E)** governs how financial institutions handle electronic transfers, including ACH debits. For retries, the rules are strict:

- You cannot **reinitiate unauthorized debits**.
- You must **stop after 2 retry attempts** for insufficient funds (R01 NSF, R09 Uncollected).
- You must **not retry** for certain return codes (R07 Authorization Revoked, R08 Stop Payment, R10 Consumer Advises Unauthorized, etc.).
- You must maintain **proof of authorization (POA)** for all retry attempts.

**Translation**: retries are not "infinite loops." They're **finite, conditional, and consent-bound.**

## The ACH Retry Decision Tree

Understanding which returns can be retried is critical for compliance:

### Retryable Returns (Max 2 attempts within 180 days)
- **R01 (Insufficient Funds)** - Account lacks sufficient funds
- **R09 (Uncollected Funds)** - Funds not available for withdrawal

### Non-Retryable Returns (Never retry)
- **R07 (Authorization Revoked)** - Customer revoked authorization
- **R08 (Stop Payment)** - Customer requested stop payment
- **R10 (Consumer Advises Unauthorized)** - Customer disputes the transaction
- **R02 (Account Closed)** - Account no longer exists
- **R03 (No Account)** - Invalid account number

**Key Rule**: Only NSF (R01) and Uncollected (R09) are retryable. Revoked/Unauthorized returns must not be retried.

## Customer Consent: The Foundation

Retries hinge on **authorization scope**:

- If the customer authorized "one debit for $100," you cannot keep retrying indefinitely.
- You can retry **twice for NSF** within 180 days, but that's it.
- For recurring debits, you must maintain valid **recurring authorization** and stop immediately upon revocation.

Leaders should:
- Bake POA retrieval into retry logic.
- Ensure revocations propagate instantly — no "one more try."

## Retry Timing: Science and Art

When to retry is both **science and art**:

- **Immediate retry** after NSF almost always fails — funds don't replenish in minutes.
- **Best practice**: wait for the customer's next payday (1–2 business days later).
- Some merchants align retries with the **15th/30th** or known payroll cycles.

**Smart retry engines use funding heuristics, not brute force.**

## Notification Requirements

Transparency is key:

- Customers must be notified of retries, either in the original authorization or via follow-up.
- Best practice: send **notifications before retrying** — "We'll retry your payment on Friday."
- Silent retries erode trust and trigger complaints.

## The Good: Why Retries Matter

### Improved Collection Rates
Strategic retries can recover 15-30% of failed payments.

### Reduced NSF Churn
Proper retry logic helps maintain customer relationships.

### Regulatory Compliance
Following Reg E requirements protects your business from fines and complaints.

## The Bad: Compliance Pitfalls

### Infinite Retries
Attempting 5–10 times until funds clear → Reg E violation.

### Retrying Revoked Payments
Once revoked, retries = unauthorized transactions.

### Silent Debits
No notification of retries = customer disputes, CFPB complaints.

### Mismatched Amounts
Retrying a different amount than authorized is not allowed.

## The Ugly: Real-World Failures

### Gym Memberships
Class-action lawsuits for retrying revoked authorizations.

### Loan Servicers
CFPB fines for hammering accounts multiple times per day.

### Subscription Services
Reputational damage after customers complained of "surprise re-debits."

## Technical Implementation: Building Compliance-First

A compliant retry engine requires several key components:

### Return Code Classification

```ruby
# Example: Return code classification system
RETURN_CODE_CLASSIFICATION = {
  retryable: {
    'R01' => 'Insufficient Funds',
    'R09' => 'Uncollected Funds'
  },
  non_retryable: {
    'R02' => 'Account Closed',
    'R03' => 'No Account',
    'R07' => 'Authorization Revoked',
    'R08' => 'Stop Payment',
    'R10' => 'Consumer Advises Unauthorized'
  },
  technical: {
    'R11' => 'Check Digit Error',
    'R12' => 'Account Sold to Another DFI'
  }
}.freeze

def can_retry?(return_code)
  RETURN_CODE_CLASSIFICATION[:retryable].key?(return_code)
end
```

### Retry Counter and Limits

```ruby
# Example: Retry attempt tracking
class RetryTracker
  def initialize(max_retries = 2, retry_window_days = 180)
    @max_retries = max_retries
    @retry_window_days = retry_window_days
    @retry_attempts = {}
  end
  
  def can_retry?(transaction_id, return_code)
    return false unless can_retry?(return_code)
    
    attempts = @retry_attempts[transaction_id] || []
    valid_attempts = attempts.select { |attempt| within_window?(attempt[:timestamp]) }
    
    valid_attempts.length < @max_retries
  end
  
  def record_retry(transaction_id)
    @retry_attempts[transaction_id] ||= []
    @retry_attempts[transaction_id] << { timestamp: Time.current }
  end
  
  def within_window?(timestamp)
    days_diff = (Time.current - timestamp) / 1.day
    days_diff <= @retry_window_days
  end
end
```

### POA Linkage and Authorization Tracking

```ruby
# Example: Proof of Authorization tracking
class AuthorizationTracker
  def initialize
    @authorizations = {}
    @revocations = Set.new
  end
  
  def add_authorization(transaction_id, poa_data)
    @authorizations[transaction_id] = poa_data.merge(
      timestamp: Time.current,
      status: 'ACTIVE'
    )
  end
  
  def revoke_authorization(transaction_id)
    @revocations.add(transaction_id)
    
    if auth = @authorizations[transaction_id]
      auth[:status] = 'REVOKED'
      auth[:revoked_at] = Time.current
    end
  end
  
  def authorized?(transaction_id)
    return false if @revocations.include?(transaction_id)
    
    auth = @authorizations[transaction_id]
    auth && auth[:status] == 'ACTIVE'
  end
  
  def get_poa(transaction_id)
    @authorizations[transaction_id]
  end
end
```

### Intelligent Retry Scheduling

```ruby
# Example: Smart retry scheduling based on funding patterns
class RetryScheduler
  def initialize
    @funding_patterns = {}
    @retry_windows = {
      'NSF' => { min_days: 2, max_days: 5, preferred_days: [15, 30] },
      'UNCOLLECTED' => { min_days: 1, max_days: 3, preferred_days: [15, 30] }
    }
  end
  
  def calculate_retry_date(return_code, customer_id, initial_date)
    window = @retry_windows[return_code]
    customer_pattern = @funding_patterns[customer_id]
    
    # Start with minimum wait time
    retry_date = initial_date + window[:min_days].days
    
    # Align with customer's funding pattern if available
    if customer_pattern&.dig(:payday)
      retry_date = align_with_payday(retry_date, customer_pattern[:payday])
    end
    
    # Ensure we don't exceed maximum window
    max_date = initial_date + window[:max_days].days
    
    [retry_date, max_date].min
  end
  
  def align_with_payday(target_date, payday)
    current_day = target_date.day
    
    if current_day < payday
      target_date.change(day: payday)
    else
      target_date.next_month.change(day: payday)
    end
  end
end
```

### Notification System Integration

```ruby
# Example: Retry notification system
class RetryNotifier
  def notify_customer(transaction_id, retry_date, amount)
    customer = get_customer(transaction_id)
    notification = {
      type: 'RETRY_SCHEDULED',
      customer_id: customer.id,
      transaction_id: transaction_id,
      retry_date: retry_date,
      amount: amount,
      message: "We'll retry your payment of $#{amount} on #{retry_date.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')}"
    }
    
    send_notification(notification)
    log_notification(notification)
  end
  
  def send_notification(notification)
    # Send email, SMS, or in-app notification
    # Implementation depends on your notification infrastructure
  end
  
  def log_notification(notification)
    # Log for audit purposes
    # Required for Reg E compliance
  end
end
```

## Complete Retry Engine Architecture

```ruby
# Example: Complete compliant retry engine
class CompliantRetryEngine
  def initialize
    @return_classifier = ReturnCodeClassifier.new
    @retry_tracker = RetryTracker.new
    @auth_tracker = AuthorizationTracker.new
    @scheduler = RetryScheduler.new
    @notifier = RetryNotifier.new
  end
  
  def process_return(return_data)
    transaction_id = return_data[:transaction_id]
    return_code = return_data[:return_code]
    amount = return_data[:amount]
    customer_id = return_data[:customer_id]
    
    # Check if we can retry this return
    unless can_retry?(transaction_id, return_code)
      handle_non_retryable_return(return_data)
      return
    end
    
    # Check if we have retry attempts remaining
    unless @retry_tracker.can_retry?(transaction_id, return_code)
      handle_max_retries_reached(return_data)
      return
    end
    
    # Check if authorization is still valid
    unless @auth_tracker.authorized?(transaction_id)
      handle_revoked_authorization(return_data)
      return
    end
    
    # Schedule retry
    retry_date = @scheduler.calculate_retry_date(
      return_code, 
      customer_id, 
      Time.current
    )
    
    schedule_retry(transaction_id, return_data, retry_date)
  end
  
  def schedule_retry(transaction_id, return_data, retry_date)
    # Record the retry attempt
    @retry_tracker.record_retry(transaction_id)
    
    # Schedule the retry
    schedule_ach_retry(transaction_id, return_data, retry_date)
    
    # Notify customer
    @notifier.notify_customer(
      transaction_id, 
      retry_date, 
      return_data[:amount]
    )
    
    # Log for audit
    @audit_log.record_retry_scheduled(transaction_id, return_data, retry_date)
  end
  
  def can_retry?(transaction_id, return_code)
    @return_classifier.can_retry?(return_code)
  end
end
```

## Audit and Compliance Logging

Every retry decision must be logged for regulatory compliance:

```ruby
# Example: Audit logging for compliance
class RetryAuditLogger
  def log_retry_decision(transaction_id, return_code, decision, reason)
    audit_entry = {
      timestamp: Time.current,
      transaction_id: transaction_id,
      return_code: return_code,
      decision: decision, # 'RETRY', 'NO_RETRY', 'MAX_RETRIES'
      reason: reason,
      user_id: current_user.id,
      session_id: session_id
    }
    
    store_audit_log(audit_entry)
  end
  
  def log_retry_attempt(transaction_id, attempt_number, scheduled_date)
    attempt_log = {
      timestamp: Time.current,
      transaction_id: transaction_id,
      attempt_number: attempt_number,
      scheduled_date: scheduled_date,
      status: 'SCHEDULED'
    }
    
    store_retry_log(attempt_log)
  end
  
  def log_retry_outcome(transaction_id, attempt_number, outcome)
    outcome_log = {
      timestamp: Time.current,
      transaction_id: transaction_id,
      attempt_number: attempt_number,
      outcome: outcome, # 'SUCCESS', 'FAILED', 'RETURNED'
      return_code: outcome[:return_code]
    }
    
    update_retry_log(transaction_id, attempt_number, outcome_log)
  end
end
```

## Best Practices for Leaders

### 1. Design for Compliance First
Retry logic is a regulatory feature, not just technical.

### 2. Surface Retry Status
Show customers retry status in-app ("Retry scheduled for 7/15").

### 3. Use Intelligent Scheduling
Align with pay cycles and funding signals.

### 4. Respect Revocation Instantly
Treat it like a "kill switch."

### 5. Log Everything
Retries are often audited; evidence matters.

### 6. Educate Your Product Team
"ACH retry" is not like retrying a failed API call.

## Final Take

ACH retries are **not optional optimizations** — they're regulated behaviors. Done right, retries improve collection rates and reduce NSF churn. Done wrong, they invite **CFPB complaints, NACHA violations, and customer anger.**

The leaders who win:

- Build retry engines as **compliance-first systems**.
- Treat retries as **customer trust moments**, not hidden background processes.
- Automate consent, notifications, and audit trails.

Because in ACH, you don't get infinite retries. You get two shots — and they better be clean.
