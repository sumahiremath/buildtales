# SEC Codes in ACH: Authorization, Compliance, and How to Not Get Burned 

*Published on: August 16, 2025*

![image info](/assets/banners/resized/20250816seccode-blog.jpg)

We once misclassified a whole batch of ACH payments â€” and our bank noticed immediately. Within days, we had a compliance warning sitting in our inbox and a very clear message: *fix your SEC codes, or else.*  

That's when we realized SEC codes aren't just three-letter labels. **They're legal shorthand for how authorization was obtained** â€” telling every bank in the chain *who's paying whom* and *what rules apply for disputes.*  

Get them right, and your payments flow smoothly. Get them wrong, and you invite disputes, audits, and compliance headaches.

**This guide breaks down what SEC codes are, how to classify ACH payments correctly, and how to stay compliant with Nacha and Reg E.**

---

## What SEC Codes Actually Do  

Every ACH batch header carries a three-letter SEC code. Example from a payroll file:  

```
5220TECH STARTUP    1234567890PPDPAYROLL    250816   1091000019000001
```

That `PPD` isn't decorative. It signals: "This is a consumer payment with signed authorization." If you change that to `CCD` for payroll, you've just violated Nacha rules by pretending employees are businesses.

**SEC = Standard Entry Class.** It encodes two things:

- **Transaction classification** â†’ consumer vs. business, paper vs. digital
- **Authorization methodology** â†’ written, online, telephone, implied

Think of it as a contract: how you got the "yes."

**The cost of getting it wrong?** Misclassify a consumer payment as business (using CCD instead of PPD), and you've just eliminated Regulation E protections. When that customer disputes the transaction, you have no legal defense â€” and you'll eat the full chargeback, plus potential fines for violating consumer protection laws.

## The Core SEC Codes You'll Actually Use

| SEC Code | When to Use | Authorization Method | Dispute Risk | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| **PPD** (Prearranged Payment & Deposit) | Recurring or single consumer payments | Signed authorization (paper/digital) | High (60-day Reg E) | Payroll, gym memberships |
| **CCD** (Cash Concentration or Disbursement) | B2B payments | Corporate agreement | Low | Vendor settlement |
| **WEB** (Internet-Initiated Entry) | Consumer payments authorized online | Online form + Nacha account validation | High fraud risk, 60-day window | Subscriptions, e-commerce |
| **TEL** (Telephone-Initiated Entry) | Consumer authorization by phone | Recorded authorization OR written confirmation to customer | High | Call center bill pay |
| **ARC** (Accounts Receivable Conversion) | Mailed-in check converted to ACH | Implied via check submission | Moderate | Insurance premiums |
| **POP** (Point-of-Purchase Conversion) | Paper check converted at POS | Implied via in-person handoff | Moderate | Legacy retail checkout |

> **Key Rule**: Consumer-facing codes = Reg E protections, 60-day dispute window. Business-facing codes = contract-only protection, minimal dispute rights.

## Advanced SEC Codes for Business

Big corporations live in enhanced codes that support remittance detail:

| SEC Code | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **CCD+** | Business payments with addenda | Vendor invoices needing line-item notes |
| **PPD+** | Consumer payments with addenda | Government benefits with detailed breakdowns |
| **CTX** | Corporate Trade Exchange, full EDI integration | Enterprise treasury, supply chain payments |

## The Cost of Addenda (CCD+ vs. CTX)

In one of the ACH audits, the Nacha auditor flagged the use of CCD+ instead of CTX for vendor payments. Why aren't we using CTX, I explained that we only needed one line of extra information and CCD+ was cost effective.

**Bank fee math** (example - fees vary by institution):
- Base ACH: $0.05
- Addenda record: $0.02
- CTX premium: $0.08 + $500/month setup

**Volume**: 25,000 payments/month

- **CCD+ cost**: $1,750/month
- **CTX cost**: $3,750/month
- **Annual savings**: $24,000

> **Lesson**: CTX is only worth it if you need structured EDI remittance data. For single-line invoices, CCD+ is the right tool. Compliance isn't about gold-plating â€” it's about defensible, efficient decisions.

## What Happens When You Screw It Up

**Fintech story**: Our misclassification issue wasn't unique. We processed a small business bill pay as WEB. When "Johnson Construction LLC" sent a payment, the ACH operator flagged it: business name + consumer code = violation.

The ACH operator issued a formal warning to our sponsor bank about incorrect SEC code usage patterns. The bank immediately escalated to us with an ultimatum: "Fix SEC logic in 72 hours or risk processing restrictions."

Their fix: auto-detect business entities and assign CCD. Example:

```ruby
def determine_sec_code(account_holder_name, transaction_type, account_type = nil)
  business_indicators = ['LLC','INC','CORP','LTD','CO','COMPANY','LP','LLP']
  is_business = business_indicators.any? { |i| account_holder_name.upcase.include?(i) }
  
  # Note: This is a simplified approach. In practice, you may need:
  # - Manual review for edge cases (sole proprietorships, DBAs, trusts)
  # - Account type verification (business vs consumer account)
  # - Customer self-identification during onboarding
  
  if is_business || account_type == 'business'
    'CCD'
  else
    case transaction_type
    when 'web_authorization' then 'WEB'
    when 'recurring_payment' then 'PPD'
    when 'phone_authorization' then 'TEL'
    when 'check_conversion' then 'ARC'
    else
      raise "Unsupported transaction type: #{transaction_type}"
    end
  end
end
```

> **Takeaway**: Banks run automated pattern checks. Misuse isn't hypothetical â€” it's detected, flagged, and escalated fast.

## ðŸ§¾ What You Must Prove â€” or Lose the Dispute

**Consumer transactions** (PPD, WEB, TEL, ARC, POP):
- Must follow Regulation E
- Customers can dispute "unauthorized" debits up to 60 days
- You need audit-proof authorization records
- Burden of proof is on you, the merchant

**Business transactions** (CCD, CCD+, CTX):
- Governed by commercial agreements
- Very limited dispute rights
- Much lower return rates
- Businesses can't casually reverse like consumers

**Retention rules that matter**:
- Keep authorization evidence for **2 years minimum**
- Produce within **10 business days** of a dispute request
- Can't produce evidence = you eat the full loss

## Implementation Scenarios

- **Online subscriptions** â†’ WEB with account validation before first debit.
- **Payroll** â†’ PPD credit with employee-signed authorization.
- **Vendor settlement** â†’ CCD with commercial agreement.
- **Call center bill pay** â†’ TEL with recorded authorization OR written confirmation to customer.

## Example: WEB Authorization Flow

Here's what proper WEB authorization looks like in code:

```ruby
# Example WEB authorization capture
class WebACHAuthorization
  def capture_authorization(customer_params)
    verify_customer_identity(customer_params)
    present_nacha_disclosures
    
    authorization = build_authorization_record(customer_params)
    validate_account_before_first_debit(authorization)
    store_authorization_record(authorization)
  end
  
  private
  
  def build_authorization_record(customer_params)
    {
      customer_id: customer_params[:id],
      account_number: mask_account(customer_params[:account]),
      routing_number: customer_params[:routing],
      amount: customer_params[:amount],
      consent_timestamp: Time.current,
      ip_address: request.remote_ip,
      user_agent: request.user_agent,
      sec_code: 'WEB',
      nacha_disclosure_shown: true,
      customer_consent: customer_params[:i_agree] == 'true'
    }
  end
  
  def validate_account_before_first_debit(auth)
    # Microdeposits, Plaid, or similar verification required
    AccountValidationService.verify(
      routing: auth[:routing_number],
      account: auth[:account_number]
    )
  end
  
  def store_authorization_record(authorization)
    # Store for 2+ years per Nacha requirements with encryption
    AuthorizationRecord.create!(authorization)
  end
end
```

## SEC Code Compliance Checklist

**âœ… Pre-Implementation**
- [ ] Map all payment flows to appropriate SEC codes
- [ ] Implement business entity detection logic
- [ ] Design authorization capture workflows
- [ ] Set up 2-year retention system for authorization records
- [ ] Include encryption and access logging for stored authorization records

**âœ… Operational Requirements**
- [ ] Automate SEC code assignment (eliminate manual selection)
- [ ] Validate accounts before first WEB debit
- [ ] Maintain call recordings for TEL transactions OR send written confirmations to customers
- [ ] Store IP addresses and timestamps for online authorizations

**âœ… Ongoing Compliance**
- [ ] Monitor transaction patterns for SEC code violations
- [ ] Monitor SEC code mix monthly and flag unexpected ratios (e.g., high WEB volume with few account validations)
- [ ] Audit authorization records quarterly
- [ ] Respond to disputes within 10 business days
- [ ] Review bank compliance feedback regularly

> **Critical Principle**: SEC codes document your authorization process. Accurate implementation provides regulatory protection; incorrect usage creates liability under consumer protection regulations.

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Reference: SEC Code Decision Tree

**Step 1: Who's the account holder?**
- Business name (LLC, INC, CORP, etc.) â†’ Use **CCD** family
- Individual person â†’ Continue to Step 2

**Step 2: How was authorization captured?**
- Online form/website â†’ **WEB** (with account validation)
- Phone call â†’ **TEL** (with recorded authorization OR written confirmation)
- Signed agreement â†’ **PPD**
- Mailed/dropped-off check â†’ **ARC**
- In-person check at register â†’ **POP**

**Step 3: Need remittance data?**
- Simple payments â†’ Standard codes (PPD, CCD, WEB, TEL)
- Invoice details needed â†’ Enhanced codes (PPD+, CCD+)
- Full EDI integration â†’ **CTX**
