# Surviving ACH File Reversals as an EM

*Coming soon...*

This article will explore the engineering management challenges when entire ACH files need to be reversed. We'll cover:

- File reversal scenarios: When and why entire files get reversed
- Team coordination: Managing engineers, operations, and business stakeholders
- System impact: Understanding which systems and databases are affected
- Customer communication: Managing expectations during reversal operations
- Compliance requirements: What you must do to stay within regulations
- Technical implementation: Building systems that can handle file reversals
- Post-reversal analysis: Learning from mistakes and improving processes
- Leadership lessons: How to lead teams through payment crises

Stay tuned for an engineering manager's guide to surviving and learning from ACH file reversal disasters.
