## Prerequisites for Reading

This series assumes:
- **Basic programming knowledge** (examples primarily in Ruby, but concepts are language-agnostic)
- **Familiarity with APIs and databases** 
- **Engineering leadership context** (though individual contributors will find value too)
- **Interest in fintech/payments** (obviously!)

No prior payment systems knowledge required - we'll build it together.

---

## About This Series

This series emerged from years of building payment systems at various stages of scale, from early-stage fintech to large established companies. Every article includes:

- **Real code examples** (Ruby, with concepts applicable to any language)
- **Practical implementation details** you won't find in documentation
- **War stories and lessons learned** from production systems
- **Compliance and regulatory context** for engineering leaders
- **Links to official documentation** and authoritative sources

The goal isn't just to explain how payment systems work, but to share the practical knowledge you need to build, scale, and lead payment infrastructure in the real world.
